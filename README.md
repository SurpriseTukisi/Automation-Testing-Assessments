Instructions to run the Projects:
Save the projects in a desired location on your machine e.g Desktop
Open the command prompt
Change directory to point to where the projects are located e.g C:\...\Desktop\TASK1_APP
Run the program by using maven commands: > mvn clean
                                       : > mvn compile
                                       : > mvn test
After successfully running the tests, open the project to extract the report file:
Goto C:\...\Desktop\TASK1_APP\test-output
Right-click on a HTLM file called ExtentReportsTestNG.html, and select a desired browse

Repeat the above steps to run TASK2_WEB project
